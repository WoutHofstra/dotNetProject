# dotNetProject

## Intro
Hello everyone! This is my very first project made using .NET. I am learning .NET because I am applying to a job that requires it, and I would like to be responsible and prepare for that. I've seen a few videos about .NET, and I have made my first little script already (A fibonacci sequence calculator). I hope this project goes well, and teaches me lots of things!

## About the project
This project is going to be a aggregator for destination information. I am getting all the information from an online API I found ([geoapify.com](https://www.geoapify.com/places-api/)), and will be handling that data efficiently, to show it in a nice way for customers. 

## Learning goals
My goals for this project are to:
1. Get comfortable with C# syntax.
2. Deepen my knowledge about API's and http requests.
3. Understand how the .NET ecosystem works, and how to work with it.
